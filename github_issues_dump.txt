Description:
## Overview
Implement an Adobe-style advanced window management system for the standalone demo, enabling users to dock, snap, group panels, and save/load custom workspace layouts.

## Background
The current standalone demo has a fixed layout. To improve user productivity and match professional tools like Adobe Creative Suite, we need a flexible panel management system.

## Requirements

### Core Features
- [ ] **Docking System**
  - [ ] Drag panels to screen edges (top, bottom, left, right)
  - [ ] Auto-dock with visual feedback (blue outlines)
  - [ ] Nested docking support (split vertically/horizontally)
  - [ ] Undock via drag or context menu

- [ ] **Snapping**
  - [ ] Auto-snap within 10px proximity
  - [ ] Snap to panel edges, window borders, or grid
  - [ ] Shift key to disable snapping
  - [ ] Visual/audio feedback

- [ ] **Panel Grouping**
  - [ ] Create tabbed groups by dragging panels together
  - [ ] Reorder tabs via drag
  - [ ] Split-view support (side-by-side, top-bottom)
  - [ ] Max 10 tabs per group

- [ ] **Workspace Management**
  - [ ] Save current layout ("Workspace > Save As...")
  - [ ] Load saved workspaces from dropdown
  - [ ] Default workspaces: "Essentials", "Advanced", "Reset"
  - [ ] Export/Import as JSON files
  - [ ] Auto-save option on exit

### Additional Features
- [ ] Collapse/expand panels to icons
- [ ] Full-screen mode (hide all panels)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+D dock, Ctrl+G group, Ctrl+S save)
- [ ] Context menus on panel headers

## Technical Implementation
```rust
// Core components needed:
pub struct WindowManager {
    panels: HashMap<PanelId, Panel>,
    layouts: HashMap<String, WorkspaceLayout>,
    dock_zones: Vec<DockZone>,
    snap_grid: SnapGrid,
}

pub struct Panel {
    id: PanelId,
    position: Position,
    size: Size,
    dock_state: DockState,
    group_id: Option<GroupId>,
}

pub enum DockState {
    Floating,
    Docked(DockPosition),
    Grouped(GroupId),
}

pub struct WorkspaceLayout {
    name: String,
    panels: Vec<PanelConfig>,
    saved_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

## Success Criteria
- Smooth drag operations at 60 FPS
- Layout changes complete in <500ms
- Layout loading in <1 second for 20+ panels
- Intuitive drag-and-drop with tooltips
- Works on Windows, macOS, Linux

## References
- Adobe Workspace Documentation
- Visual Studio docking system
- Blender UI management

## Priority
**HIGH** - Essential for professional workflow and user productivity
